# 2Fast 2Clean — Real PayFast + Pro UI

## Why your page looked plain
If you see a black-and-white page, it means `assets/styles.css` didn’t load. Ensure:
- The file exists at `assets/styles.css`
- Each HTML file has `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/styles.css" />`
- Your repo structure matches this README exactly

## Run locally
Open `index.html` directly, or:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
